A software replacement for your glasses so that you don't have to wear them ever again.


I'm a software developer. My mom always have to wear her glasses in front of tv,mobile and pc. That's the motivation behind.

I don't know the possibility of this thing. I don't know how to create patent of this idea so I'm creating a github repo instead.



Here in free time I'll try to implement this.



well it should everything that we see like tv screen , mobile screen , movie in projector, holograms & VR too.


That's too big for me.

I'm planing to start with PC screen let's see how it goes.

I need someone , some doctor or eye specialist to help me. If you are the one or you know someone who is, let me know.



Stay Tuned !
